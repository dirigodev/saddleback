                We're investing in a new high speed detachable quad, new snowmaking, a dramatic renovation of the lodge and ticket pricing aimed at making the Saddleback skiing experience as accessible as ever. Here's what won't change: a friendly, laid back culture, a wide diversity of terrain for all abilities and a steadfast commitment to see the Saddleback family get its home back. Without you we're just another mountain, and the reality is we're not just another mountain.

                            The new Rangeley Detachable Quad more than triples uphill capacity over its predecessor and reduces ride time for the lift from 11 minutes to 4. That means a lot more skiing and a lot less riding lifts. The new Rangeley also serves all levels of terrain.
                            <br /><br /> Expect further lift upgrades in seasons to come!

We’re also updating the pub menu, with an emphasis on local ingredient sourcing to support area producers and provide the tastiest, highest quality food possible. You can also expect to see Saddleback-branded microbrews produced right here in Maine!

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Saddleback Mountain Ski Resort comes out of a 5 year hibernation announcing purchase of high speed lift that will be the cornerstone of the mountain’s future</h3>
        <p>February 18, 2020</p>
        <p class="italic">The mountain, an iconic fixture in New England Skiing for generations, will also be selling season passes in the middle of next month.</p>

        <p class="press-release-text">
            Rangeley, Maine Boston-based Arctaris Impact Fund, which recently purchased Saddleback Mountain, announced earlier this month they have purchased a high-speed detachable quad chairlift for the coming season. The new lift will replace the aging Rangeley double chair that had been the main lift of the mountain for 57 years.
            <br><br> The new Rangeley high speed quad will reduce the ride time from about 11 minutes to about 4 and move 2,400 people up the mountain per hour; up from the current rate of 750. The impact will be that our Saddleback guests will spend a lot less time on a lift and a lot more time skiing or riding. The new lift will also set a new standard of excellence at the resort and transform the uphill experience for Saddleback guests.
            <br><br> “To see the faith of the community rewarded with this remarkable commitment by Arctaris is moving,” said Doc Tulin, Marketing Director at Saddleback Mountain, “and shows they understand the needs of the mountain and the community. The skiing experience at Saddleback has always been exceptional, and now the experience of getting up the mountain will match that.”
            <br><br>The next step in the process of reopening the mountain will be selling season passes, either online or in person, starting in the middle of March. While the complete website won’t be on-line until the Fall, we will have an initial page set up in time to service demand for season passes at SaddlebackMaine.com, with an estimated date of March 18th for the launch.
            <br><br> While the mountain will be making significant investments in snowmaking capacity, in the lodge experience, and has purchased the new, high-speed detachable quad, Saddleback will always be about its unique culture; a laid back community of people who love the outdoors, who love skiing and who want to be surrounded by others who share those values.
            <br><br><strong>About Saddleback Mountain</strong>
            <br><br>Located in the beautiful High Peaks and Lakes district of western Maine, Saddleback Mountain was founded in 1960 and has grown its reputation for exceptional snow, some of the best skiing terrain in the East and a friendly, laid- back culture. At 4,120 feet of elevation and 2,000 feet of vertical, Saddleback is Maine’s third biggest mountain, and its base elevation of 2,100 feet is Maine’s highest. Just below the mountain is the iconic village of Rangeley, which is the gateway to Rangeley Lake, Mooselookmeguntic and Richardson Lakes.
