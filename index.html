        <p class="pricing-text">
            Saddleback is pleased to offer a new way to try the improved mountain experience this winter, The Test Drive Pass.
            For only $135.00 (Adults) or $120.00 (Senior, Casablanca, College, Junior) enjoy three, unrestricted, days of skiing or riding and this great price is just half of the deal.
            From the date you purchase the Test Drive Pass, until the end of the 14th day Saddleback is open, you can upgrade to a full pass by simply paying the difference. Yes, you receive full credit for the amount already spent.
            The Test Drive Pass will ONLY be available during July and August, so if you’re looking for an option, big enough to provide you the full, re-invigorated Saddleback experience, this is for you.

            In response to questions some of you have asked, we would like to post our simple assurance plan for all of our pass holders. This assurance guarantee applies specifically to the risks associated with COVID-19. Operating dates limited by weather will not be guaranteed.
            <br>
            If, due to COVID-19, the resort opening is delayed beyond January 1st, all passholders will receive a pro-rated credit for the time lost, to be automatically applied to their ’21 – ’22 season pass purchase.
            <br>
            If, due to COVID-19, the resort closes before March 21st, all pass holders will receive a pro-rated credit to be automatically applied to the ’21 – ’22 season pass purchase.
            <br>
            Based on what we know now, we do not believe COVID-19 will prevent the resort from opening this winter. In the event things change and we are not able to open at all this winter due to the pandemic, passholders will receive a 100% credit to be automatically applied to the ’21 – ’22 season.

                        <p>
                            The new Rangeley Detachable Quad more than triples uphill capacity over its predecessor and reduces ride time for the lift from 11 minutes to 4. That means a lot more skiing and a lot less riding lifts. The new Rangeley also serves all levels of terrain.
                            <br /><br /> Expect further lift upgrades in seasons to come!

We’re also updating the pub menu, with an emphasis on local ingredient sourcing to support area producers and provide the tastiest, highest quality food possible. You can also expect to see Saddleback-branded microbrews produced right here in Maine!

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">Saddleback Mountain Ski Resort comes out of a 5 year hibernation announcing purchase of high speed lift that will be the cornerstone of the mountain’s future</h3>
        <p>February 18, 2020</p>
        <p class="italic">The mountain, an iconic fixture in New England Skiing for generations, will also be selling season passes in the middle of next month.</p>

        <p class="press-release-text">
            Rangeley, Maine Boston-based Arctaris Impact Fund, which recently purchased Saddleback Mountain, announced earlier this month they have purchased a high-speed detachable quad chairlift for the coming season. The new lift will replace the aging Rangeley double chair that had been the main lift of the mountain for 57 years.
            <br><br> The new Rangeley high speed quad will reduce the ride time from about 11 minutes to about 4 and move 2,400 people up the mountain per hour; up from the current rate of 750. The impact will be that our Saddleback guests will spend a lot less time on a lift and a lot more time skiing or riding. The new lift will also set a new standard of excellence at the resort and transform the uphill experience for Saddleback guests.
            <br><br> “To see the faith of the community rewarded with this remarkable commitment by Arctaris is moving,” said Doc Tulin, Marketing Director at Saddleback Mountain, “and shows they understand the needs of the mountain and the community. The skiing experience at Saddleback has always been exceptional, and now the experience of getting up the mountain will match that.”
            <br><br>The next step in the process of reopening the mountain will be selling season passes, either online or in person, starting in the middle of March. While the complete website won’t be on-line until the Fall, we will have an initial page set up in time to service demand for season passes at SaddlebackMaine.com, with an estimated date of March 18th for the launch.
            <br><br> While the mountain will be making significant investments in snowmaking capacity, in the lodge experience, and has purchased the new, high-speed detachable quad, Saddleback will always be about its unique culture; a laid back community of people who love the outdoors, who love skiing and who want to be surrounded by others who share those values.
            <br><br><strong>About Saddleback Mountain</strong>
            <br><br>Located in the beautiful High Peaks and Lakes district of western Maine, Saddleback Mountain was founded in 1960 and has grown its reputation for exceptional snow, some of the best skiing terrain in the East and a friendly, laid- back culture. At 4,120 feet of elevation and 2,000 feet of vertical, Saddleback is Maine’s third biggest mountain, and its base elevation of 2,100 feet is Maine’s highest. Just below the mountain is the iconic village of Rangeley, which is the gateway to Rangeley Lake, Mooselookmeguntic and Richardson Lakes.
