                An anonymous donor, with close ties to the Rangeley/Oquossoc region announced a major gift to make Saddleback Mountain and skiing accessible to 
every child in the Rangeley schools for the next 5 years. 
            </br></br>
In a culture that prioritizes time in front of a screen over time outdoors, and understanding the impact a sedentary lifestyle and disconnection from nature 
is having on the physical and mental health of our entire population, especially our youth, places like Saddleback are a critical connection to the outdoors 
for our youth. The key is creating a consistent connection and this donation will ensure that for years to come. 
        </br></br>
Saddleback Mountain is immensely grateful for the support of such donors and the difference they make to our entire community.
    </br></br>
</p>
<p class="resort-desc">
<b>Life Just Keeps Getting Better</b>
</p>
 <p class="resort-desc">
Saddleback is very pleased to be able to announce that we are lowering the prices for the following season pass categories in response to the long conversations we have had with some of you affected by current circumstances.
</br></br>
From now through Thanksgiving, the Junior and College Passes will now be only $324.00 (down from 449.00) and the Casablanca Pass will now be $399.00 (down from $599.00).
</br></br>
We hope that these price reductions will help some of you be able to spend more time outdoors, enjoying all the great things found at Saddleback:
</br></br>
- New high-speed lift<br>
- Expanded lodge<br>
- Most natural snow in Maine<br>
- Increased snowmaking<br>
- New outdoor programs<br>
- The friendliest lakeside ski town you could imagine<br>
- The Casablanca Glades<br>

</br></br>
                Without you, we’re just another mountain and the truth is, we’re not just another mountain.

            In response to questions some of you have asked, we would like to post our simple assurance plan for all of our pass holders. This assurance guarantee applies specifically to the risks associated with COVID-19. Operating dates limited by weather will not be guaranteed.
            <br>
            If, due to COVID-19, the resort opening is delayed beyond January 1st, all passholders will receive a pro-rated credit for the time lost, to be automatically applied to their ’21 – ’22 season pass purchase.
            <br>
            If, due to COVID-19, the resort closes before March 21st, all pass holders will receive a pro-rated credit to be automatically applied to the ’21 – ’22 season pass purchase.
            <br>
            Based on what we know now, we do not believe COVID-19 will prevent the resort from opening this winter. In the event things change and we are not able to open at all this winter due to the pandemic, passholders will receive a 100% credit to be automatically applied to the ’21 – ’22 season.

                        <p>
                            The new Rangeley Detachable Quad more than triples uphill capacity over its predecessor and reduces ride time for the lift from 11 minutes to 4. That means a lot more skiing and a lot less riding lifts. The new Rangeley also serves all levels of terrain.
                            <br /><br /> Expect further lift upgrades in seasons to come!

                            At Saddleback, we're fortunate to have the highest natural snowfall of all the major Maine ski resorts. To improve on Mother Nature’s generosity, we’re making significant investments in our system and will continue to make additional investments for years to come.

                            You'll find significant renovations to the base lodge, resulting in a more comfortable, aesthetically pleasing, and energy efficient space for booting up, grabbing lunch, or just relaxing with friends. We’re also updating the pub menu, with an emphasis on local ingredient sourcing to support area producers and provide the tastiest, highest quality food possible. You can also expect to see Saddleback-branded microbrews produced right here in Maine!

That’s why we’re implementing fair ticket pricing, with a goal of keeping skiing accessible to all. We think you’ll find that Saddleback offers some of the most affordable alpine skiing anywhere, without compromising on quality or service.

        <p class="italic">Saddleback Mountain Announces Anonymous Gift to Rangeley Community
        </br>
Gift Focuses on Access to Healthy, Active Outdoor Lifestyle for Local Students</p>

        <p class="press-release-text">
            An anonymous donor, with close ties to the Rangeley/Oquossoc region announced a major gift to make Saddleback Mountain and skiing accessible to every child in the Rangeley schools for the next 5 years.
            <br><br>“With this gift, Saddleback Mountain will be able to offer season passes to every child in the Rangeley school district for $50/year for the next 5 years,” said Wolfe Tone of the Saddleback Mountain Foundation. “These donors’ generosity in the early stages of Saddleback’s philanthropy campaign was instrumental in helping get the mountain back on its feet and this gift continues their legacy of making a difference in the region.”
            <br><br>In a culture that prioritizes time in front of a screen over time outdoors, and understanding the impact a sedentary lifestyle and disconnection from nature is having on the physical and mental health of our entire population, especially our youth, places like Saddleback are a critical connection to the outdoors for our youth. The key is creating a consistent connection and this donation will ensure that for years to come.
            <br><br>The Mountain is planning to reopen on December 15th with a new Doppelmayr high speed detachable quad chair which will reduce the ride time from 11 minutes to only 4 minutes and increase the uphill capacity from 750 skiers/hour to 2,400 skiers/hour. Saddleback’s lodge has also undergone major reconstruction to double the dining capacity and significantly enhance the air exchange capabilities with a new HVAC system. “Our plan is to open as the safest ski area in the East,” said Jimmy Quimby, Mountain Ops Director and Chief Safety Officer at Saddleback Mountain.
            <br><br><strong>About Saddleback Mountain</strong>
            <br><br>Located in the beautiful High Peaks and Lakes district of western Maine, Saddleback Mountain was founded in 1960 and has grown its reputation for exceptional snow, some of the best skiing terrain in the East and a friendly, laid- back culture. At 4,120 feet of elevation and 2,000 feet of vertical, Saddleback is Maine’s third biggest mountain, and its base elevation of 2,100 feet is Maine’s highest. Just below the mountain is the iconic village of Rangeley, which is the gateway to Rangeley Lake, Mooselookmeguntic and Richardson Lakes.
